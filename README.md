# rust-tsp, "Rusty Genes"
- A Rust implementation of a genetic program to solve the travelling salesperson problem
- See [this repo](https://github.com/LTeder/rust-symboreg) for my other attempt at writing a genetic program / coding in Rust

Here I will experiment with AI pair-programming by using ChatGPT in [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so/).
This way I hope to implement the visualization and performance graphing in Rust, where previously I used Python.
